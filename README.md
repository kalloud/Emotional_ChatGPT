# Emotional ChatGPT

This repository contains the code files I used in my master thesis project entitled "Improving ChatGPT's Emotional Intelligence Through Prompt Engineering" and published as a conference paper. The model details and the architecture used in emotion classification and in emotion injection are described in our paper:
https://aclanthology.org/2023.ranlp-1.18/

The master thesis contains two parts: an emotion classification part (see Emotion Classification folder) and an emotion injection part (the root folder).


Note that in the emotion injection part, we compared regular ChatGPT (ChatGPT-A) to two altered versions of the chatbot: ChatGPT-B and ChatGPT-C 

However, during development phase, they didn't have these names yet and they were called ChatEPT and prompt2. 
Due to some code files requiring the folder names to be ChatEPT and prompt2 instead to run properly, we didn't change the folders and files names.
